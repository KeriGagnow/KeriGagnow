I am a Computer Science Junior at St. Thomas!  I specalized in Software Development, Software Engineering, Data Analytics and Information Technology to name a few!

I am currently working on an Android To-Do app using Kotlin (It's not published to the public at the time as it is a prototype) and custom creating my own personal page where I display my current projects!
